# Sockets Teaser

> A bad example of not knowing stuff.

This demonstrate the code for a recent test I did which (while not flopping) I had a very ininformed approach to. This code is updated to work as for how the tasks were defined. From this task I learned that there is no proper way to have and input/output stream and an objectStream on the same socket without extra handling. Took me literally 4 hours to grasp that echoing from the client breaks all headers of the serialized student (and that flushing was not the issue). 

Still my favourite course ).
